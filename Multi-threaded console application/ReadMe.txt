Simple Multi-Threaded Application:

Console application replicating conveyor belts connected to work stations.  Each work station
has a number of groups of products to move along the shared belts.  The multi-threaded approach
allows all of the work stations to move their groups out of their initial locations until all
are finished in a parallel fashion.  Application to real world manufacturing lines.
